This program takes in a text file of items which are either for sale or wanted and matches up buyers and sellers.
It does so by adding each item to an array and checking to see if a buyer and sell of the same object are willing
to agree on a price. Once a buyer and sell are matched up, they are removed from the array and the product sold
is printed out to the terminal. At the end, each remaining item is printed out at the terminal as well. The total
number of operations required to complete this task is also printed out.
