This program creates a red-black tree that is populated by
movies specified by a text file. The text file "MovieList.txt"
should be input as a command-line arguement.

The user can rent movies, print the inventory of all movies,
delete a movie, count the total number of titles avaliable,
and count the longest path from the root node to the bottom
of the tree.

Note: there is a bug in the code which results in a black node
height violation when deleting some movies.
