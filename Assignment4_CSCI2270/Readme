This program creates a FIFO Queue implimented as a ten member
array which sends messages to a list of cities. The cities
are hard-coded into the C++ file. The message comes from the
"messageIn.txt" file. The user has the option to Enqueue or
Dequeue words from the file one word at a time or can send the
entire message all at once. Dequeueing a word sends it to all
of the cities and then back again. 

Note that the cities are as nodes in a linked list, and
messages traverse the linked list forwards and then back again
once they are dequeued from the array.
