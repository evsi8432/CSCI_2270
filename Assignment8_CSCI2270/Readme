This program creates a graph of locations in the US. The
program can print all of the cities specified by the file,
find out which cities are accessable from one another (each
subgraph is called a "district"), and discover the shortest
path between any two cities, both by raw distance and number
of cities visited. The extra credit works only for the
bestPlaces.txt file and finds the quickest way to travel
between all of the cities and end up back at the starting
city.

The user must decide between two files to put as a command
line arguement: "bestPlaces.txt" and "zombieCities.txt". 
bestPlaces.txt has edges between all nodes, and
zombieCities.txt considers a zombie apacolypse where zombies
make travel between some cities impossible.
