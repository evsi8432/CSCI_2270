This program takes in a text file of text with no punctuation or capitalization and counts the number of occurances of
every word in that file. However, the 50 most common words in the English language are ignored. At the end, the program
outputs the "n" (specified by the user) most common words in the file (ignoring the 50 most common) and the number of 
occurances of each of those "n" words. It also counts the total number of unique words as well as the overall number of 
words in the document. The program takes the text file as the first command line arguement and "n" as the second command 
line arguement.
